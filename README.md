📍 Campus Navigation & Utility Planner

A Python implementation of a mini campus–mapping system featuring BST, AVL, Graph algorithms, and Expression Trees.

📘 Overview

campus_planner.py is an educational, all-in-one Python script demonstrating several data structures and algorithms through a fictional campus navigation system.

The project includes:

A Building ADT

Binary Search Tree (BST)

AVL Self-Balancing Tree

Graph (Adjacency List + Adjacency Matrix)

Graph Traversal Algorithms: BFS, DFS

Shortest Path: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal’s Algorithm

Expression Tree for Evaluating Expressions

Demonstration routines showing how all components work together.

This project is perfect for CS students studying data structures & algorithms or for anyone who wants a single script demonstrating these concepts with a practical narrative.
